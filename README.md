# difference between fit_transform() and transform():

`fit_transform()` and `transform()` are methods used in machine learning, particularly when working with data preprocessing steps like scaling or encoding.

1. **fit_transform():**
   - **Purpose:** This method combines two steps: fitting the preprocessing transformation (learning the parameters from the data) and applying it (transforming the data based on those parameters).
   - **When to use:** You use `fit_transform()` on your training data. It learns and applies the transformation to your data in one go.
   - **Example:** If you're scaling your data, `fit_transform()` will calculate the mean and standard deviation from your training data and then scale the data accordingly.

2. **transform():**
   - **Purpose:** This method applies a transformation that was previously learned using `fit_transform()` or `fit()`.
   - **When to use:** You use `transform()` on your test data (or any new data). It applies the transformation using parameters learned from the training data.
   - **Example:** After using `fit_transform()` on your training data to scale it, you use `transform()` on your test data to scale it using the same mean and standard deviation calculated from the training data.

**In simple terms:**
- **Fit:** Learn something from the data.
- **Transform:** Apply what you've learned.

**Key takeaway:** `fit_transform()` does both learning from the data and applying the transformation, whereas `transform()` only applies a transformation that was already learned. Use `fit_transform()` on training data and `transform()` on test or new data to ensure consistency in how your data is processed.
